    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>Latkes (potato pancakes) are a must-have at Hanukkah, but are really wonderful any time of the year! This is my mother's recipe, which is honestly the best potato latke I've had.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups shredded potato</li>

        <li>¼ cup grated onion   </li>   
            
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
            
        <li>6 saltine crackers, or as needed, crushed</li>
            
        <li>½ teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
            
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            
        <li>½ cup vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix potato, onion, eggs, crushed crackers, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat 1/4 inch oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Drop spoonfuls of the potato mixture, first pressing potato mixture against the side of the bowl to remove excess liquid, into the hot oil; slightly flatten the latkes into the oil with the back of your spoon so they are an even thickness.</li>
        <li>Cook in batches in the hot oil until browned and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Drain latkes on a paper towel-line plate.</li>
    </ol>
