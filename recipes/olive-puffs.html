        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These puff pastry-wrapped olives are our family's favorite holiday appetizer. We make them with a variety of olives - pimento stuffed green, plump kalamata, Provencal - just make sure they are pitted. We like to use strongly flavored olives; the flavor of canned ripe olives disappears in the puff pastry. You can make these ahead, and freeze; allow 30 minutes for the pastry to thaw before baking. Another advantage: the kids like to make them and eat them.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>24 pimento-stuffed green olives</li>
    
                <li>1 (17.25 ounce) package frozen puff pastry, thawed</li>   
                
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Cut pastry into strips about 6 inches long and 1/2 inch wide. Wrap a belt of pastry around each olive. Place on an ungreased baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Bake for 20 minutes, or until golden brown.</li>
            </ol>
